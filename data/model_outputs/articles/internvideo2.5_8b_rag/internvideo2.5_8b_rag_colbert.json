This ambitious project began in the late 20th century and was completed in 2021 after years of development, construction, and testing. The telescope was launched into orbit on December 25, 2021, aboard a European Ariane 6 rocket, marking the beginning of its mission to explore distant parts of the universe that were previously unobservable due to Earth's atmosphere. Its primary goal is to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies, planets beyond our solar system, and the early stages of star and planet formation. The JWST carries a suite of instruments including a camera, spectrograph, and near-infrared imager and spectrometer radiometer, which allows it to capture detailed images across a broad spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, from visible light to the infrared region. The telescope's observations have already yielded groundbreaking results, providing insights into the mysteries of the universe that were previously inaccessible to ground-based telescopes. The successful launch and deployment of the JWST represent a major milestone in astronomical research, paving the way for future discoveries and advancements in astrophysics."
