This approach seeks to address the growing demand for data processing and storage by leveraging the natural cooling properties of the ocean and reducing latency for the majority of the global population that lives within 200 kilometers of a coast. The project involves submerging large cylindrical tanks containing server racks and associated equipment beneath the sea surface. These data centers are designed for rapid deployment, with the capability to be operational within 90 days. The underwater environment also provides a stable temperature and reduced need for active cooling systems, which can significantly lower energy consumption compared to traditional land-based data centers. Additionally, the marine growth observed on the exterior of the submerged tanks highlights the integration of these structures with the ocean ecosystem.</lead>"

Research into mRNA technology began in the early 1970s when scientists in the UK explored protein production and initiated experiments with mRNA. By the 1990s, the first experiments involving the use of mRNA in vaccine development were conducted. A breakthrough in 2005 led to methods for safely delivering mRNA into cells. Further research following coronavirus outbreaks in the 2010s focused on using spike proteins in vaccine development. In 2020, the genetic sequence of COVID-19 was published, leading to the rapid creation and deployment of the first mRNA-based vaccines. These vaccines have since been administered widely, with healthcare providers emphasizing the importance of vaccination for protecting individuals and communities. Efforts to vaccinate populations have included children and adults, with healthcare workers administering doses in various settings, such as clinics and community centers. Additionally, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidelines regarding vaccine dosages, including recommendations for males aged 12-39 to receive their doses eight weeks apart. Collaborative efforts among pharmaceutical companies like Sanofi and GSK have resulted in the development of new vaccines, such as the Moxiforin Injection, which has demonstrated high efficacy rates against severe disease and hospitalizations.
