The project involves deploying cylindrical data center units, which are designed to operate efficiently in marine environments. These units are submerged in the ocean, typically near coastlines, to take advantage of natural cooling from seawater, reducing energy consumption and operational costs. Additionally, placing data centers closer to where most of the global population resides helps reduce latency and improve the performance of online services. Project Natick has demonstrated that these underwater data centers can be deployed rapidly, within 90 days, and can function reliably for extended periods, as evidenced by successful test deployments. The project also explores the environmental impact of such installations, including their effect on marine life and the potential for sustainable operations."

Over the course of a week, the region received a year's worth of rain, with over a metre of rain recorded at Bushland Beach. The heavy rainfall led to widespread flooding, submerging large areas of the city and surrounding regions, transforming roads and residential areas into vast bodies of water. The city's dam reached capacity, necessitating the high-risk release of water to prevent further damage, with almost two million litres of water per second being released at its peak\u2014equivalent to an Olympic swimming pool every 1.5 seconds. This action, combined with continued heavy rainfall, posed a significant threat to tens of thousands of homes and resulted in substantial insurance costs. Military personnel and local authorities were deployed to assist with rescue operations and provide support, including sandbagging and transportation. The flooding also disrupted daily life, with canoes and kayaks becoming a common mode of transportation through the inundated streets. Despite the ongoing relief efforts, meteorologists warned of continued heavy rainfall, destructive winds, and the potential for further flash flooding.</lead>"
