The initiative seeks to address the challenge of placing data centers closer to populations living near coastlines, thereby reducing latency and improving internet speeds. A key aspect of Project Natick involves deploying a large, cylindrical data center module, which is designed to be fully submerged in the ocean. This approach leverages the natural cooling properties of seawater, reduces energy consumption, and allows for rapid deployment of data centers in just 90 days. Since approximately 40% of the global population resides within 200 kilometers of the coast, these underwater data centers could significantly enhance connectivity and reduce the environmental impact of traditional land-based facilities. The project has been tested with a prototype that was successfully submerged and operated in various locations, demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of this novel technology."
