This breakthrough has significantly advanced the field of genetic engineering, enabling researchers to modify the DNA of animals, plants, and microorganisms with unprecedented precision. The award marks the first time a science Nobel Prize has been given to two women, highlighting the importance of their collaborative efforts and the broader implications of their discovery for the future of molecular biology and medicine."
