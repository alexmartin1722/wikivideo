A major breakthrough occurred in 2005 with the development of methods to safely deliver mRNA into cells, paving the way for further advancements. In 2014, following outbreaks of coronaviruses, researchers intensified their focus on using spike proteins in vaccine development. This groundwork culminated in 2020, when the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) was published, enabling the rapid creation of the first mRNA vaccines against the disease. These vaccines have since been crucial in combating the global pandemic, offering a new and effective tool in public health."
