The scene alternates between two main shots: one of Senator Orrin Hatch and another of Mark Zuckerberg. Senator Hatch is seen speaking, likely posing questions or making statements, while Zuckerberg listens attentively and responds. The background shows other individuals, presumably senators and staff, seated in the hearing room.\n\nThe video then transitions to a news anchor in a studio setting, providing commentary or additional information about the testimony. The studio has a backdrop of a world map with city lights, emphasizing the global impact of the event. The anchor is dressed professionally, wearing a suit and tie, and appears to be addressing the audience directly.\n\nThroughout the video, there are prompts for viewers to \"WATCH MORE\" and \"SUBSCRIBE,\" indicating that this is part of a larger news broadcast available on a digital platform. The overall tone of the video is serious and informative, reflecting the gravity of the Senate hearing and its implications for Facebook and social media regulation. The video is a news segment from the South China Morning Post, featuring a congressional hearing where Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, is being questioned by Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois. The setting is a formal hearing room with several people in suits and ties seated around a table equipped with microphones and nameplates.\n\nSenator Durbin begins by asking Zuckerberg if he would be comfortable sharing the name of the hotel he stayed in the previous night. Zuckerberg responds with hesitation, saying \"Um \u2013 no.\" Durbin then asks if Zuckerberg would share the names of the people he has messaged that week, to which Zuckerberg replies that he would not choose to do that publicly.\n\nDurbin uses these questions to highlight the issue of privacy and the extent to which personal information is shared in modern America, particularly in the context of social media platforms like Facebook. He emphasizes the question of what information Facebook collects, who they send it to, and whether they ask for permission in advance. He asks if it is fair for Facebook users to expect control over their information.\n\nZuckerberg agrees, stating that everyone should have control over how their information is used. The video concludes with the South China Morning Post logo and website address displayed on the screen. The video is a compilation of clips from a Senate Judiciary & Commerce Committees Joint Hearing on Facebook Data Use, featuring Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The hearing appears to be addressing concerns about data privacy and the use of user data by Facebook.\n\n1. **Opening Scene**: The video starts with a title card that reads, \"These senators were confused about the internet at Zuckerberg\u2019s hearing,\" setting the tone for the content.\n2. **Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)**: He is seen speaking, possibly asking questions or making statements related to the hearing. His expression suggests he is engaged in the discussion.\n3. **Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Washington)**: She is also shown speaking, likely addressing issues related to data privacy and Facebook's practices.\n4. **Senator Deb Fischer (R-Nebraska)**: She is seen interacting with Zuckerberg, possibly asking him questions or discussing specific points about Facebook's data policies.\n5. **Senator Roy Blunt (R-Missouri)**: He is shown speaking, likely contributing to the discussion on data privacy and Facebook's role in protecting user information.\n6. **Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii)**: He is seen speaking as well, possibly raising concerns or questions about Facebook's data handling practices.\n7. **Mark Zuckerberg**: Throughout the video, Zuckerberg is shown responding to the senators' questions, explaining Facebook's policies, and addressing their concerns.\n8. **Closing Scene**: The video ends with a text overlay that reads, \"Good thing these lawmakers are responsible for protecting your online privacy,\" highlighting the irony of the situation given the senators' apparent confusion about the internet.\n\nThe video is produced by ThinkProgress, as indicated by the logo in the top right corner. The credits at the end mention Victoria Fleischer as the Director of Video, Kira Brekke and Katelyn Marmon as Video Producers, and the music \"SZ Instrumental\" by Botanica. The video is a news broadcast from Fox News, covering a Senate Committee hearing on Facebook data and privacy concerns. The scene features two main individuals: a senator and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The senator, dressed in a white shirt and tie, is speaking into a microphone, addressing Zuckerberg about the company's practices regarding user data. Zuckerberg, wearing a dark suit and blue tie, is seated and listening attentively. The background shows other committee members and staff. The news ticker at the bottom of the screen provides additional information about current events and headlines. The overall setting is formal, indicating the seriousness of the discussion on data privacy and security. The video discusses highly anticipated congressional hearings that have lasted for hours or even days. It highlights three notable examples:\n\n1. **Anita Hill in 1991**: Her testimony lasted 8 hours.\n2. **Hillary Clinton in 2015**: Her hearing lasted 11 hours.\n3. **Lt. Col. Oliver North in 1987**: His testimony spanned 6 days.\n\nThe video then shifts focus to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is set to testify before two Senate Committees on Tuesday. The Senate Judiciary Committee has 21 members, and the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee has 27 members. Some senators serve on both committees, so a total of 44 senators will attend the hearing. Each senator has four minutes to question Zuckerberg about Facebook's protection of user data, which equates to at least three hours of questions, not including the time it takes for Zuckerberg to read his opening statement and provide answers.\n\nZuckerberg is scheduled to return to Capitol Hill at 10 a.m. on Wednesday for a second hearing with the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The video concludes with the CBS News logo and credits for the video and imagery suppliers. The video is a news report about Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, who is testifying on Capitol Hill regarding privacy scandals that have affected his company. The report mentions that data from over 87 million Facebook users was accessed by a political research firm during the 2016 Presidential Election.

It takes time for these ballots to arrive, be inspected for authenticity, and then counted. This is depicted through images of mailboxes, magnifying glasses inspecting ballots, and a computer screen showing the vote count.\n\n5. **Impact on Election Results**: In close elections with a high percentage of mail-in ballots, it could take days or even weeks to determine the winner. This is illustrated with a graph showing a close election and a pile of mail-in ballots.\n\n6. **COVID-19 Impact**: The video notes that many voters concerned about COVID-19 are expected to vote by mail, which increases the likelihood that the 2020 presidential election may not be decided quickly. This is shown through images of people wearing masks and holding mail-in ballots.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The video concludes with the VOA logo and the tagline \"A Free Press Matters,\" emphasizing the importance of accurate and timely reporting in such scenarios.",
