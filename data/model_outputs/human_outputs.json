        "article": "Hurricane Irma was a record-setting Hurricane that struck the south Atlantic region in early September, 2017, and that caused widespread damage. At the time, Irma was the most powerful Hurricane recorded in the open Atlantic region and was the second-strongest ever to hit Cuba. Beginning as a tropic wave, Irma struck many places—including the Lesser Antilles, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Barbuda, Antigua, St. Martin, Puerto Rico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba—as a Category 5 storm—as well as Florida as a Category 3 storm. At its peak intensity, Irma reached more than 180 mph winds and caused severe flooding and damage to buildings and infrastructure throughout the region."

        "query": "test_pt2_query_351",
        "article": "On December 6th, 2022, ABC news declared Raphael Warnock the winner of the Georgia Senate Race. Warnock, the incumbent Democrat, defeated his opponent, republican Hershel Walker, in a runoff election by a little more than 1% of the vote. Warnock had initially won election in 2020, when he, along with President Joe Biden and Senator John Ossoff, led a surprise sweep of the presidential and senate elections in the historically conservative state. A month prior to the runoff, Warnock also held a slight lead over Walker on election day. At that point, with 99% of the votes counted, Warnock led by 35,429 votes, 49.4% to 48.5%. Despite this, in Georgia a runoff is triggered if no candidate wins at least 50% of the vote in the general election. With Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver pulling roughly 2% of the vote, MSNBC and CNN both reported that neither Warnock nor Walker were able to reach this threshold in November. This result was generally expected, as polling averages from the weekend prior to the initial general election showed an extremely tight race, from anywhere between a 0.8% margin from MSNBC to just a 0.1% margin from FiveThirtyEight. Many battleground senate races were decided relatively early on Election day, with North Carolina, Ohio, and Florida all being called for Republicans, while Pennsylvania and New Hampshire were called for Democrats. However, after these initial results, both Georgia and Wisconsin, where Ron Johnson held a slight lead over Mandela Barnes, were too close to call, while Nevada and Arizona also took longer for a victor to be declared. Interestingly, in contrast to the Georgia senate race, the Georgia gubernatorial election was decided without a runoff, with Republican Brian Kemp winning re-election in his rematch with Democrat Stacey Abrams, indicating a large number of split-ticket voters. This came despite Abrams’ long-term investments into an activist-driven campaign.  In the lead up to the runoff election, Walker heavily emphasized Joe Biden’s low approval ratings and the economy, while Warnock focused on Walker’s lack of knowledge about issues and allegations of violence. The incumbent senator’s strategy focused on turning out the democratic base in cities, while the challenger focused on more conservative rural areas; both campaigns targeted moderate educated voters in the suburbs around Atlanta. In addition, Georgia Democrats won a key court battle to allow for early voting in runoff elections. This decision challenged SB 202, a 2021 state law that limited early voting periods and restricted weekend voting"

        "article": "A magnitude 7.0 earthquake hit southcentral Alaska on Friday, November 30, 2018. The earthquake hit approximately 7 miles north of Anchorage at 8:29 AM. Anchorage is Alaska’s largest city, with half of the state’s population living in the region. Following the earthquake, the National Tsunami Warning Center issued and then canceled a tsunami warning for the coastal zones of southern Alaska. Governor Bill Walker issued a disaster declaration. In the three hours after the earthquake, the US Geological Survey recorded at least 30 aftershocks with magnitudes ranging from 2.7 to 5.7; hundreds of aftershocks were eventually recorded. During the earthquake and its aftershocks, students and office workers sheltered in place under their desks, and some buildings were evacuated, including the air traffic control tower at the Anchorage airport. The earthquake caused major infrastructure damage across the city, according to the Anchorage police department. Impacts include damage to roadways and water mains, visible cracks in buildings, stores and homes in disarray, and one house fire caused by a damaged gas pipe. No deaths have been reported."
