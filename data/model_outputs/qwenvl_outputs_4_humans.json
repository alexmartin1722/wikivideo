The storm made landfall in the Caribbean, particularly devastating the islands of St. Martin, the British Virgin Islands, and Barbuda. It then moved northwest, causing extensive damage in the Bahamas and Cuba before making landfall in Southwest Florida on September 10. The hurricane brought torrential rain, storm surges, and high winds, resulting in widespread flooding, structural damage, and power outages. In Florida, cities such as Miami Beach and Tampa experienced severe flooding and wind damage. The storm's impact was felt across multiple states, leading to widespread evacuations and a significant humanitarian response.
